{title: Song of the Spring Breeze}
{key: C}

{section: Verse 1}
[C]Snow and cold wind of the bitter dark night,
[F]Lift off the weight of your [C]cold ruthless hand;
[C]Spring breeze will [G7]chase you and [Am]bring flowery fragrances,
[F]Breathing new [C]life to the [G7]suffocated [C]hills.

{section: Verse 2}
Though you most ruthless of winter winds blow,
Doomed in a moment you too shall be calmed;
Butterfly awake and you meadow lark of spring,
Our land has suffered this nightmare too long;
