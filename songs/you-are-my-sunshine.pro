{title: You Are My Sunshine}
{key: E}

{section: Chorus}
[E]You are my sunshine, my only sunshine,
[A]You make me happy, when skies are grey.
[A]You'll never know Lord, how much I love you.
[E]Please don't take my sunshine away.

{{section: Verse 1}
[E]There is a meadow, high on a mountain,
[A]Where skylark and wild rose abound,
[A]Th'eternal homeland my heart desires,
[E]Shines like gold at the rainbow's end

{{section: Verse 2}
[E]Through the long winter and harsh wind blowing
[A]All creatures die on barren soil,
[A]Now sunlight beaming the ice to streamlets,
[E]Earth in spring is a garden of joy.
