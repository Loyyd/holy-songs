{title: When I Behold the Lord}
{key: E}

{section: Verse 1}
[E]When I behold the Lord of all, my old self dies away.
[B7]So dies the world of sinfulness giving birth to good.
[C#m]Soon a new self emerges, clear and bright and pure;
[F#m]Come and behold the new life, heaven and earth reborn.

{section: Verse 2}
[E]Now I behold Jerusalem, city of loveliness,
[B7]Gently descending from above, ever to be my own.
[A]Joy never ending is with me, long as the Lord is near;
[E]Joy ever flows in sweetness, river of precious life.

{section: Verse 3}
[B7]Kingdom of God eternal fervently I desired;
[E]Heavenly rays so softy fall, shining the Sun of Grace.
[C#m]Springing forth in ripeness, fruit of the Tree of Life,
[F#m]Torment of doubt is over, gone is the shadow of death.

{section: Verse 4}
[B7]Torturing every part of me, sinfulness rules my soul.
[E]Still God can raise me purified, giving creation to me.
[A]Letting me live in his palace, shining with golden light;
[E]Boundless His love and kindness, boundless His love for me!
