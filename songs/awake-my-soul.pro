[D]

{section: Verse 1}

[D]How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
[D]I struggle to find any truth in your lies
[D]And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
[D]My weakness I feel I must finally show

{section: Verse 2}
[D]Lend me your hand and we'll[A] conquer them[D] all
But[D] lend me your heart and I'll[A] just let you[D] fall
[D]Lend me your eyes, I can[A] change what you[D] see
But your[D] soul you must keep,[A] totally[D] free
