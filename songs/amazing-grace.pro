[E]Amazing Grace, how swee[A]t the soun[E]d,
That saved a wretch like m[B7]e.
I o[E]nce was lo[E7]st but n[A]ow am fou[E]nd,

Was blind, but[B7] now I [E]see.

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.

{section: Verse 3}
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far,
And Grace will lead me home.

{section: Verse 4}
The Lord has promised good to me.
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

{section: Verse 5}
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.
