{section: Verse 1}
[A]Almost heaven, [F#m]West Virginia,
[E]Blue Ridge Mountains, [D]Shenandoah [A]River.
Life is [F#m]old there, older than the trees,
[E]Younger than the mountains,[D] blowin' like a br[A]eeze.

{section: Chorus}
Country r[A]oads, take me [E]home,
To the pl[F#m]ace where I be[D]long:
West Vir[A]ginia, mountain mo[E]mma,
Take me[D] home, country ro[A]ads.

{section: Verse 2}
All my mem'ries, gather 'round her,
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

{section: Bridge}
[F#m]I hear her[E] voice, in the[A] mornin' hours she calls me,
[D]The radio[A] reminds me of[E] my home far away.
[F#m]And drivin' down[G] the road,
I get[D] a feelin' that I[A] should have been[E] home yesterday,
Yes[E7]terday.
